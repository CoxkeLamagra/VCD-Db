VCD-db README (20.03.2005)

Installation.

1)  Unzip the VCD-db file on your webserver. 
2)  You must have a database access. 
3)  Create an empty database.
	At the moment the following databases are supported 
	(although others might work like Oracle) 
	a) MySQL (3.x, 4.x and up) 
	b) Microsoft SQL (7 and 2000) 
	c) Postgre SQL 7.5 or 8
	d) IBM DB2 (7.2 and up) 
	e) SQLite
4)  If your webserver is on a Win32 box this step is unneccassary,
	otherwise if your webserver is on a Unix/Linux box, you must have an Shell Access 
	to chmod some files and folders. Open up a console session to your box and
	go to the directory where you extracted the VCD-DB zip file.
	Enter the following commands: 
	
	chmod 0777 classes/VCDConstants.php
	chmod 0777 upload
	chmod 0777 upload/cache
	chmod 0777 upload/covers
	chmod 0777 upload/pornstars
	chmod 0777 upload/screenshots/albums
	chmod 0777 upload/screenshots/generated
	chmod 0777 upload/thumbnails
	
	if you are using SQLite on Linux machine you will probable need to "touch"
	vcddb.sqlite in your vcddb root folder and chmod it to 0777.
	

5)  After a successfull install, delete the install folder and 
    if you are running VCD-db on a linux box chmod the VCDConstants.php back to 0644
    to prevent any further writing or modification to the file.

Notes.
1) You can change the template that VCD-db uses by modifying the "STYLE" constant in the VCDConstants.php
   file, for example try changing it to "includes/templates/exprm/" for a new look.

2) All major settings are stored in the "classes/VCDConstants.php" file.

3) If your text gets escaped in the database (like this-> "Mary\'s") then edit your php.ini and set
  "magic_quotes_gpc = Off" and "magic_quotes_runtime = Off" to disable them.
  
4) You can access the XML RSS feed generated by VCD-db under the "yourserver.com/vcddb/rss/" path.

5) If you have made your own templates or translation, please send them to me (konni the author) and I will
   include it in future releases.
   
6) The VCD-db GUI client does not work with VCD-db installed on IIS servers at the moment, 
   this will be fixed in the future.
   
7) When using PostgreSQL, make sure the encoding is set to Latin1 not Unicode
